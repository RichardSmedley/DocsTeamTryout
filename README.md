## Couchbase Docs Team Tryout

Welcome to the Couchbase Documentation Team Tryout!

This is a short README to explain the tryout process.

### How The Tryout Works

This tryout consists of a guide for you to edit. It is a short "walkthrough of the Travel sample" application, and honestly is pretty terrible and has a ton of problems. Your challenge is to see how many you can find and fix!

You have **1 week** to complete this tryout. Here are the steps to take:

1. **Read the contribution guide.** If you haven't already, you should first read the documentation contribution guide in the accompanying **CONTRIBUTING.md**. Pay close attention to the **Contributing Changes > Style Guide** section as you will be tested based on information in this section.
2. **Edit the Guide.** Edit the **Part1.md** file to make your improvements to the mock guide. Changes can include grammatical consistency, appropriate use of formatting elements, correct integration of images and completion of the `// TODO` comment.
3. **Turn in Tryout.** There are two options to turn in your tryout.
	- (preferred) Upload your changes to GitHub. The docs team at Couchbase uses Git to manage documentation for different versions and products. If you are not familiar with Git that's absolutely fine, you can refer to the [GitHub docs](https://help.github.com/) to follow the steps outlined below:
		1. Create a new repository on [GitHub.com](http://github.com).
		2. Initialize the local **DocsTeamTryout** folder as a Git repository.
		3. Push the version we sent you to the master branch on GitHub.
		4. Push your edited version to a new branch (called `guide-update` for example) on GitHub.
		5. Open a pull request from the branch that contains the edits into master.
		6. In a comment on the pull request, add a list of bulleted comments for the original author about things to improve for next time.
		7. Send us the link to the pull request!
	- Send us back the zipped folder when you are done with your changes and a list of bulleted comments for the original author about things to improve for next time. We will perform a diff against the original version to see your changes, and will let you know whether you passed the tryout.

Good luck!

### FAQ

#### Why am I editing a guide?

The process of tech editing this guide tells us a lot about your development and writing skills, attention to detail, and work ethic, which will help us determine if you're a good match for the team.

####  How does formatting work?

The contribution guide is based upon Dita syntax, but this tryout is in Markdown obviously. Please follow the general principles outlined in the formatting guide, even though specific Markdown tags may be different.
